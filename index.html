            <h1>ERP Finance Automation</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Mel Nizam. I specialize in SAP Finance and Integration, with a focus on automating and optimizing financial processes across complex enterprise environments. Over the past two decades, I’ve worked across multiple industries—public sector, aerospace, defense, oil and gas, and manufacturing—supporting companies like Shell Trading, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing, and Phillips 66.</p>
            <p>I started my SAP journey at SAP Labs as part of the core product development team, contributing to foundational components like the Application Interface Framework (AIF). Since then, I’ve built deep expertise in SAP S/4HANA Financials, integrating with both internal systems and external platforms .</p>
            <p>This site is a collection of tools, programs, and resources I’ve created to help automate, streamline, and modernize finance operations in SAP-centric organizations.</p>
